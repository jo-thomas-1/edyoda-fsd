						<td class="food_description">Kuzhimanthi is a mandi or manthi, a Yemeni dish of flavoured rice and meat. Mandi is said to have originated from the Arabic word ‘nada’, meaning ‘dewy’, referring to the texture and softness of the meat in a mandi. The name kuzhimanthi is a portmanteau of mandi and kuzhy, the Malayalam word for the deep pit in which this dish has to be cooked. Kuzhimanthi is made of basmati rice, spiced and slow-cooked in a pit in the ground while the accompanying chicken is cooked over it, allowing the juices from the chicken to drip down and flavour the rice further. While similar in many ways to Kuzhimanthi, the original Yemeni mandi differs in that it is typically cooked with lamb, with the rice being cooked in lamb stock, and is usually spiced less, and served with tzatziki.</td>
