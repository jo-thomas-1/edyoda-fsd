## Questions

console.clear();

### Question 1:

- var str1 = 'Today is';
- var str2 = '      a beautiful day     '
- var str3 = ' In Hawaii.     '
- Result = 'Today is a beautiful day In Hawaii.'
- Use the str1, str2, str3 variables to create the Result string. Keep the extra spaces, lowercase and uppercase letters in mind.

### Question 2:

- var enteredAlphabet = 'd' or "D"
- Write a program to check vowel, consonant or non-alphabet using switch case. Change value of enteredAlphabet and check if your code works fine.

### Question 3:

- Write a JavaScript program to create menu driven calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply and divide) using switch case. The calculator should input two numbers and an operator: '+', '-', '\*', '/' from the user. It should perform operation according to the operator entered and must take input in given format.

### Question 4:

- Write a JavaScript program to input sides of a triangle and check whether a triangle is equilateral, scalene or isosceles triangle using if else.
- Properties of triangle:
- A triangle is said Equilateral Triangle, if all its sides are equal. If a, b, c are three sides of triangle. Then, the triangle is equilateral only if a == b == c.
- A triangle is said Isosceles Triangle, if its two sides are equal. If a, b, c are three sides of triangle. Then, the triangle is isosceles if either a == b or a == c or b == c.
- A triangle is said Scalene Triangle, if none of its sides are equal.

### Question 5:

- Write a JavaScript program to input electricity unit charge and calculate the total electricity bill according to the given condition:
- For first 50 units Rs. 0.50/unit
- For next 100 units Rs. 0.75/unit
- For next 100 units Rs. 1.20/unit
- For unit above 250 Rs. 1.50/unit. An additional surcharge of 20% is added to the bill.
- For example, input: 20 units then bill is Rs10
- Total Units: 300
- 50 * 0.5 = 25
- 100 * 0.75 = 75
- 100 * 1.2 = 120
- 50 * 1.5 = 75
- Total = 295 + 20% surcharge on 295
- Result = INR 354
